maybe dwm is better
xmonad is based on dwm (a rewrite in haskell of it)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm
https://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial/

dwm is from suckless, written in  and needs to be compiled as well (no prob since I we use home-manager already)
dwm used the suckless dmenu instead of rofi (the dmenu replacement I use to launch apps)

on the other hand awesome is based on dwm as well and allows lua scripting.


xmonad configuration looks horrible and complex for multi screen setups:

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-IndependentScreens.html

the xfce panel doesn't work with xmonad as the window manager also knows which windows are on the current workspace/what workspaces are even available.
So some of this will have to be re-done in the other window manageer

* window list
* active workspace
* workspaces
